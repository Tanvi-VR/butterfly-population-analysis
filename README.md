# Final Project

## Note

This project was created in collaboration with Emily Zhuo for the UC Berkeley course ESPM 157: Data Science for Global Change Ecology.

## Description

In this notebook, we are examining the way in which warmer temperatures as a result of climate change and human encroachment through urbanization has impacted butterfly populations in the United Kingdom. 
Butterflies play an important ecological role and are apt indicators of environmental changes, making them an import species to study when analyzing the broader implications of climate change on global ecosystems. 
To examine this, we will answer the following in this notebook:

1. How have different UK butterfly species (farmland, habitat, non-specialist, woodland) populations changed over time, and can we identify any common trends among species with similar ecological niches or habitat preferences?
2. Is there a correlation between changes in butterfly populations and specific indicators of human encroachment (e.g., urbanization rates, agricultural land expansion) in the UK over the same period?
3. How does environmental changes, sepcifically temperature fluctuations, affect butterfly population?

## Data

To analyze fluctuations in butterfly populations and they ways they may be influenced by warming temperatures and urbanization, we will use data sourced from the following:

1. Butterfly population data: https://records.nbnatlas.org/occurrences/search?q=data_resource_uid%3Adr1206&fq=-occurrence_status%3A%22absent%22&fq=data_resource_uid%3A%22dr1206%22&fq=basis_of_record%3A%22HumanObservation%22&nbn_loading=true#tab_overview
2. Weather data: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/datasets/Tmean/date/UK.txt
3. Urbanization data: united-kingdom-urban-population.csv

## Scientific Background

Butterflies serve a vital ecological role. They support the reproduction of over 75% of all flowering plants and thousands of plant species and crops, making them key players in agriculture production and economic growth. Additionally, pollinators support biodiversity by enabling plant reproduction, which prevents soil erosion, stabilizes soils, sequesters carbon, and protects against severe weather. In turn, plant communities contribute to environmental health through water purification, pollution prevention, oxygen production, and climate regulation. Fluctuations in pollinator populations can indicate environmental stressors, severe weather impacts, or changes in predation pressure because of their short life spans. These fluctuations also affect ecosystem stability by altering gene flow, local adaptation rates, and species interactions. Natural areas act as vital refuges for pollinators, ensuring population stability and aiding ecosystem resilience.

Overall, because butterflies are sensitive indicators of environmental changes and because they play a vital ecological role, they are important species to study in order to understand the way ecosystems might be affected by a changing climate.
