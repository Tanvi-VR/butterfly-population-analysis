Project Proposal: Analyzing the Impact of Environmental Changes on UK Butterfly Populations

Partners: Emily Zhuo and Tanvi Raman

## Description of the project

Butterflies are known to be sensitive indicators of environmental change, making them excellent subjects for studying the effects of climate change and habitat loss on biodiversity. This project aims to investigate the relationship between environmental changes and the population trends of a variety of butterfly species in the United Kingdom. By analyzing the "Changes in UK butterfly species" dataset from Our World in Data, we will explore how different butterfly species have responded to environmental pressures over time.

## Data

To address this topic, we will need data on butterfly populations in the United Kingdom, climate and temperature data, land useage data, and information on conservation efforts in the United Kingdom during overlapping time periods. 

Specifically, we will use the "Changes in UK butterfly species" dataset from Our World in Data:
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/changes-uk-butterfly

*CSV link to download the data:* https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/changes-uk-butterfly.csv?v=1&csvType=full&useColumnShortNames=true

This dataset provides information on the population changes of a variety of UK butterfly species over time. 

We will supplement this data with additional information on climate trends, land use changes, and conservation efforts in the UK during the same period. Specifically, we plan to make use of the following supplemental resources for this information:
- Climate trends/ Weather data: https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/gb/london/EGLC/date/2023-11
- Land use data: https://www.ceh.ac.uk/data/ukceh-land-cover-maps

## Questions/Analysis tasks

To better understand how butterfly populations have responded to environmental changes, we plan to perform the following analyses: 
- How have different UK butterfly species (farmland, habitat, non-specialist, woodland) populations changed over time, and can we identify any common trends among species with similar ecological niches or habitat preferences?
- Is there a correlation between changes in butterfly populations and specific indicators of human encroachment (e.g., urbanization rates, agricultural land expansion) in the UK over the same period?
- How does environmental changes, sepcifically temperature fluctuations, affect butterfly population?

**Objective of our Analysis**

With the above analysis, we aim to accomplish the following:
1. Quantify the impact of human encroachment and environmental changes on UK butterfly populations
2. Provide insights into how different butterfly species are adapting to or struggling with changing environments due to both human influence and temperature changes

This project will contribute to our understanding of how human activities are affecting local ecosystems and biodiversity, using butterflies as a model system. The findings could have implications for conservation efforts and land-use policies in the UK and potentially in other regions facing similar environmental pressures.
